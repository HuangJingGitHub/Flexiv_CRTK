# Flexiv_CRTK
Flexiv CRTK wrappers provide [CRTK](https://github.com/collaborative-robotics/documentation/wiki) wrappers for [Flexiv RDK](https://rdk.flexiv.com/en/) (v 0.6). 

The C++ wrapper has been tested and the Python wrapper is in development. Since these wrappers are based on derived classes of base classes in Flexiv RDK, newer versions of RDK can also use them with just a few necessary adjustments.
