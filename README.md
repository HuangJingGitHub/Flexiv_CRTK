# Flexiv_CRTK
Flexiv CRTK wrapper provides a [CRTK](https://github.com/collaborative-robotics/documentation/wiki) wrapper for [Flexiv RDK] (https://rdk.flexiv.com/en/) (v 0.6). 
The C++ wrapper has been tested and Python wrapper is in development. Since the wrapper is based on derived class of base class in Flexiv RDK, newer versions of RDK can also use it 
with just a few adjustments.
