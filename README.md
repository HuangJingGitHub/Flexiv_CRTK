# Flexiv_CRTK
Flexiv CRTK wrappers provide [CRTK](https://github.com/collaborative-robotics/documentation/wiki) wrappers for [Flexiv RDK](https://rdk.flexiv.com/en/) (v 0.6). 

C++ and Python wrappers are provided. Since these wrappers are based on derived classes of base classes in Flexiv RDK, newer versions of RDK can also use them with just a few necessary adjustments.

**C++ Wrapper Usage** 
All the source files need to be included as in standard usage.
