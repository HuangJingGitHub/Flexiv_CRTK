# Flexiv_CRTK
Flexiv CRTK wrappers provide [CRTK (Collaborative Robotics Toolkit)](https://collaborative-robotics.github.io/)-style wrappers for [Flexiv RDK](https://github.com/flexivrobotics/flexiv_rdk) (v 0.6) for Flexiv Rizon 4 robot. 

C++ and Python wrappers are available with support from JHU team. As wrappers are using derived classes of base classes in Flexiv RDK, they are also compatible with newer versions of RDK after necessary adjustments.

Available Flexiv states-CRTK query commands (first two columns) and Flexiv methods-CRTK motion commands (last two columns) correspondences are as follows:
| flexiv::RobotStates:: | CRTK query command | flexiv::Robot:: | CRTK motion command |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| q |   measured_js() | streamJointPositiion() | servo_jp() |
| theta | â‰ˆmeasured_js() | streamJointTorque() | servo_jf() |
| tcpPose | measure_cp() | streamTcpPose() | servo_cp() |
| tcpVel | measured_cv() | sendJointPosition() | interpolate_jp()
| extRenchInBase | measured_cf() | sendTcpPose() | interpolate_cp() |
| /(unavailable) | setpoint_js/cp/cv/cf() | executePrimitive("MoveJ, ...") | move_jp() |
| / | goal_js() | executePrimitive("MovePTP, ...") | move_cp() |
| tcpPoseDes | goal_cp() | / | servo/interpolate_jv()/cv()/cf() |
| / | goal_cv() | / | servo/interpolate_jr()/cr() |

## C++ Wrapper
The C++ wrapper does not rely on a built Flexiv RDK. It only needs to include two folders from Flexiv RDK:
- The `include/flexiv` folder containing public source code.
- The `lib` folder containing compiled outputs from unpublicized source code.

The `Robot_CRTK.hpp`, where CRTK methods are implemented, includes source files in `include/flexiv`. Use the wrapper following
- In the program, replace `#include your path to Robot.hpp` with `#include your path to Robot_CRTK.hpp`.
- When instancing a robot object, use `flexiv::Robot_CRTK robot(robotIP, localIP)` to replace `flexiv::Robot robot(robotIP, localIP)`. Everything else remains the same as in the RDK. CRTK methods will be invokable, e.g. `robot.measured_jp()` returns the robot's joint position.
- When compiling the program, add the corresponding platform-dependent `.a` file in `lib` to the linked library list of the output target. 

**Notice**
There are ROS-related setups in the current `Robot_CRTK.hpp`, which can be safely removed without influencing the CRTK implementation.

## Python Wrapper
The Python wrapper does not rely on a built Flexiv RDK. It only needs to include the `lib_py` folder from Flexiv RDK. `flexiv_crtk.py` implements CRTK methods and inherits methods 
of the original flexivrdk.Robot class. Import `flexiv_crtk.py` in the program to use CRTK methods.
