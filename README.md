# Flexiv_CRTK
Flexiv CRTK wrappers provide [CRTK](https://github.com/collaborative-robotics/documentation/wiki) wrappers for [Flexiv RDK](https://rdk.flexiv.com/en/](https://github.com/flexivrobotics/flexiv_rdk). (v 0.6). 

C++ and Python wrappers are provided. As wrappers are based on derived classes of base classes in Flexiv RDK, newer versions of RDK can use them just with necessary adjustments.

## C++ Wrapper Usage
All the source files need to be included as in standard usage.
