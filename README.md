# Flexiv_CRTK
Flexiv CRTK wrappers provide [CRTK](https://github.com/collaborative-robotics/documentation/wiki) wrappers for [Flexiv RDK](https://github.com/flexivrobotics/flexiv_rdk). (v 0.6). 

C++ and Python wrappers are provided. As wrappers are based on derived classes of base classes in Flexiv RDK, newer versions of RDK can use them just with necessary adjustments.

## C++ Wrapper Usage
The wrapper does not rely on a built Flexiv RDK, it just needs to include the source files provided in the folder 'include/flexiv'
